			Dear whoever happens to be reading this right now, I'm glad to see you here. My name is Tina Shi and I am majoring in Computer Science and Art. As the majors suggest, I am passionate in <span class="highlight">designing, illustrating, and coding</span>, where creativity can flow and the limitless possibilities and potentials can be both exciting and frustrating. I am interested in interactive media, especially games, where <span class="highlight">art and technology come together to tell storeis, construct worlds, and create experiences</span>. Recently, I've been practicing pixel art for numerous game dev projects and also a website design. It's intricate in that there are only so many pixels you get to work with to represent something, yet at the same time, because there is a limited number of pixels, it also emphasizes abstraction, the ability to capture the essence within vagueness. Aside from pixel art, there's still a lot that I would like to learn and master.<br><br>
			This site is where I'll showcase my work for <span class="highlight">ART102MM: Mobile Media</span>. I hope you enjoy your brief visit.

				<a href="https://line-of-action.com/" class="highlight">Line of Action</a> is an online library for gesture and figure drawing references. It's easy to tailor what you want to draw and how long you'd like to draw for each session with its filter for images and different options for duration. It has some pretty good references in store and has a pretty clean website design.
