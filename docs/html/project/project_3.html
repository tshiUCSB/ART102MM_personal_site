			This project is based on data collected by Santa Barbara County Public Health. The number of cubes spawned is in proportion to the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases as of October 23rd, 2020. A portion of the black cubes are infectious such that they will connect and infect other cubes within proximity. With time, infected cubes will slowly wither away. By writing down words in the input box, you can recover cubes and give them a color based on the ASCII codes from your message. Like words, their recovery is fleeting,  vulnerable to infections as long as there is still a single infectious cubes remaining. During a pandemic, it is difficult to enforce social distancing and protect ourselves and those we care about. Although words tend to pale against the weight they bear, the least we can do is to express our condolences to what have been lost.
